\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The last two decades have increasingly seen a push for more holistic,
ecosystem-based fisheries management (Larkin, 1996; Link, 2002). In
part, this is a recognition that considering single species in isolation
produces riskier and less robust outcomes long-term (Patrick and Link,
2015). In several high-profile cases, fisheries management has failed to
prevent collapses because they did not reduce fishing pressure in
responses to changes in natural mortality (\(M\)), recruitment, or
migration patterns caused by dynamics external to the stock in question
(Northern cod: Shelton et al., 2006; Rose and Rowe, 2015; Gulf of Maine
cod: Pershing et al., 2015; Pacific sardine: Zwolinski and Demer, 2012).
This is particularly concerning in the context of climate change and the
wide range of biological processes---often assumed to be constant---in
stock assessments that are likely to be affected (Stock et al., 2011).

One approach to account for changing productivity is to explicitly link
population processes to environmental covariates in single-species stock
assessments, i.e.~the mechanistic approach \emph{sensu} Punt et al.
(2014). Traditional single-species assessments are based on internal
population dynamics and the effect of fishing mortality (\(F\)), and
typically ignore effects of the environment or interactions with other
species, even though fisheries scientists have long known that these are
important drivers of time-varying population processes,
e.g.~recruitment, mortality, growth, and movement (Garstang, 1900;
Hjort, 1914). Despite how counterintuitive this may seem to ecologists
and oceanographers who study such relationships, the evidence for direct
linkages to specific environmental covariates is often weak and can
break down over time (McClatchie et al., 2010; Myers, 1998).
Additionally, the primary goal of most assessments is to provide
management advice on near-term sustainable harvest levels---not to
explain ecological relationships. Even if an environmental covariate
directly affects fish productivity, including the effect in an
assessment may not improve management advice if the effect is weak (De
Oliveira and Butterworth, 2005). Worse, including environmental effects
in an assessment or management system has been shown to actually provide
worse management in some cases (De Oliveira and Butterworth, 2005; Punt
et al., 2014; Walters and Collie, 1988). This can be true even in cases
of relatively well-understood mechanistic links between oceanic
conditions and fish populations, as in the case of sea surface
temperature and Pacific sardine (Hill et al., 2018; Zwolinski and Demer,
2012). Still, incorporating mechanistic environment-productivity links
does have the potential to reduce uncertainty in reference points and
improve projections of stock status (Miller et al., 2016).

An alternative approach is to allow biological parameters to vary
stochastically over time, without explanation, i.e.~the empirical
approach \emph{sensu} Punt et al. (2014). Statistical catch-at-age
(SCAA) models typically only estimate year-specific recruitment
(\(R_t\)) and \(F_t\), often as deviations from a mean, e.g.
\(\text{log}R_t = \text{log}R_0 + \epsilon_t\). The main reason that
other parameters are assumed constant is simply that there are not
enough degrees of freedom to estimate many time-varying parameters. One
common solution is to penalize the deviations, e.g.
\(\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon)\), although the
penalty terms, \(\sigma^2_\epsilon\), must be fixed or iteratively tuned
and are therefore somewhat subjective (Aeberhard et al., 2018; Methot
and Taylor, 2011; Methot and Wetzel, 2013; Xu et al., 2019). State-space
models that treat parameters as unobserved states can avoid such
subjectivity by estimating the penalty terms as variance parameters
constraining random effects. In this way, state-space models can allow
processes to vary in time while simultaneously estimating fewer
parameters.

Although state-space stock assessments have existed for some time
(Gudmundsson, 1994; Mendelssohn, 1988; Sullivan, 1992), the recent
development of Template Model Builder (TMB, Kristensen et al., 2016)
software to perform efficient Laplace approximation has greatly expanded
their use (Cadigan, 2016; Miller et al., 2016; Nielsen and Berg, 2014).
In addition to the key advantage of objectively estimating variance, or
``data weighting'', parameters, state-space models naturally predict
unobserved states, and therefore handle missing data and short-term
projections in a straightforward way (ICES, 2020). In comparisons with
SCAA models, they generally have larger (more realistic) uncertainty and
lower retrospective bias (\textbf{Miller et al.~in prep}).

Retrospective bias can occur when changing environmental conditions lead
to changes in productivity that are unaccounted for in stock
assessments, and this is a concern commen to several groundfish stocks
on the Northeast U.S. Shelf (Brooks and Legault, 2016). The Northeast
U.S. Shelf ecosystem is rapidly changing, and this has motivated
managers to make the ``continue{[}d{]} development of stock assessment
models that include environmental terms'' a top priority (Hare et al.,
2016). In addition to providing short-term (1-3 years) catch advice with
reduced retrospective bias, it is hoped that environment-linked
assessments will help create realistic rebuilding plans in the
medium-term (3-10 years) for stocks that have not rebounded in response
to dramatic decreases in \(F\). Miller et al. (2016) developed a
state-space model for yellowtail flounder with an environmental effect
on recruitment, which reduced retrospective patterns and residual
variance. Additional applications that include environmental effects on
growth, \(M\), and maturity in a similar state-space framework have also
proven promising (Miller and Hyun, 2018; Miller et al., 2018; O'Leary et
al., 2019; Xu, Timothy J. Miller, et al., 2018).

To address the needs of fisheries management in a changing climate, we
seek an assessment framework that combines both the empirical and
mechanistic approaches. Namely, it should be able to 1) estimate
time-varying parameters as random effects (i.e.~a state-space model),
and 2) include environmental effects directly on biological parameters.
The framework should also allow for easy testing against status quo SCAA
models to ease gradual adoption through the ``research track'' or
``benchmark'' assessment process (Lynch et al., 2018). The objectives of
this manuscript are to introduce the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM)
framework and demonstrate its ability to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  estimate time- and age-varying random effects on survival, \(M\), and
  selectivity;
\item
  fit environmental time-series with process and observation error,
  missing data, and a link to a population process; and
\item
  simulate new data and random effects to conduct self- and cross-tests
  (\emph{sensu} Deroba et al., 2015) to estimate bias in parameters and
  derived quantities.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, we describe how the above are implemented using the open-source
WHAM software package (Miller and Stock, 2020).

\hypertarget{model-description}{%
\subsection{Model description}\label{model-description}}

WHAM is a generalization and extension of Miller et al. (2016), which is
in part a re-coding of the Age-Structured Assessment Program (ASAP,
Legault and Restrepo, 1998; Miller and Legault, 2015) in TMB. WHAM
retains characteristics of ASAP, such as its input file structure and
reliance on empirical weight-at-age data, so that existing assessments
in the U.S. Northeast can be easily replicated and tested against models
with state-space and environmental effects in a single framework.

\emph{Either put core model equations here or in supplement}

\hypertarget{processes-with-random-effects}{%
\subsubsection{Processes with random
effects}\label{processes-with-random-effects}}

WHAM primarily (\textbf{??}) diverges from ASAP through the
implementation of random effects on four processes: survival (numbers at
age transitions, \emph{NAA}), natural mortality (\emph{M}), selectivity
(\emph{Sel}), and environmental covariates (\emph{Ecov}). Across
processes, WHAM makes heavy use of first-order autoregression, AR1, to
constrain the random effects, especially a 2D AR1 covariance structure
which is AR1 over both age and year. The 2D AR1 structure has been
widely used to model deviations by age and year in the parameters
\(F_{a,y}\) (Nielsen and Berg, 2014), \(M_{a,y}\) (Cadigan, 2016; Stock
et al., n.d.), \(Sel_{a,y}\) (Xu, Thorson, et al., 2018), and
\(N_{a,y}\) (Stock et al., n.d.), as well as in the catch (\(C_{a,y}\))
and survey index (\(I_{a,y}\)) observations (Berg and Nielsen, 2016).

\hypertarget{numbers-at-age-naa-survival}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Numbers at age (\emph{NAA}) /
survival}{Numbers at age (NAA) / survival}}\label{numbers-at-age-naa-survival}}

The stock equations in WHAM that describe the transitions between
numbers at age are identical to Miller et al. (2016) and Nielsen and
Berg (2014):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NAA}
  \text{log}N_{a,y}=\left\{
    \begin{array}{@{}lll@{}}
      \text{log} \left( f(SSB_{y-1}) \right) + \varepsilon_{1,y}, & \text{if}\ a = 1 \\
      \text{log} \left( N_{a-1,y-1} \right) - Z_{a-1,y-1} + \varepsilon_{a,y}, & \text{if}\ 1 < a < A \\
      \text{log} \left( N_{A-1,y-1} e^{-Z_{A-1,y-1}} + N_{A,y-1} e^{-Z_{A,y-1}} \right) + \varepsilon_{A,y}, & \text{if}\ a = A
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

where \(N_{a,y}\) are the numbers at age \emph{a} in year \emph{y},
\emph{Z} is the total mortality rate (\(F + M\)), and \(f\) is the
stock-recruit function, \emph{Y} is the total number of observation and
prediction years, and \emph{A} represents the plus-group. In this
analysis we demonstrate four possible models for the \emph{NAA}
deviations, \(\varepsilon_{a,y}\).

m1 is most similar to a SCAA model, where only recruitment deviations,
\(\varepsilon_{1,y}\), are estimated (i.e. \(\varepsilon_{a,y} = 0\) for
\(a > 1\) in Eqn \ref{eq:NAA}). In m1, the recruitment deviations are
assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID):

\[\varepsilon_{1,y} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_R)\] The only
difference between m1 and a SCAA is that the recruitment variance,
\(\sigma^2_R\), is estimated as a parameter within the model instead of
being fixed or tuned externally.

m2 is the same as m1, except that the recruitment deviations are AR1
with autocorrelation parameter \(\rho_R\):

\[\varepsilon_{1,y+1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\rho_R \varepsilon_{1,y}, \sigma^2_R)\]

m3 is the ``full state-space'' model from Nielsen and Berg (2014) and
Miller et al. (2016), where all numbers at age are independent random
effects and:

\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_{a,y} \sim \left\{
    \begin{array}{@{}ll@{}}
      \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_R \right), & \text{if}\ a = 1 \\
      \mathcal{N} \left( 0, \sigma^2_a \right), & \text{if}\ a > 1
    \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

where \(\sigma^2_a\) for all ages \(a > 1\) are assumed to be the same
but different from age \(a = 1\), i.e.~recruitment. This assumption is
sensible because survival variations for young-of-the-year (recruitment)
are typically larger than for other ages.

m4 treats the numbers at all ages as random effects, as in m3, but
constrains the \emph{NAA} deviations with a 2D AR1 structure:

\[\mathbf{E} \sim \mathcal{MVN} \left( 0, \Sigma \right)\]

where
\(\mathbf{E} = (\varepsilon_{1,1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{1,Y-1}, \varepsilon_{2,1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{2,Y-1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{A,1}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{A,Y-1})'\)
is a vector of all \emph{NAA} deviations, \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\) is the
covariance matrix of \(\mathbf{E}\) defined by:

\[ \text{Cov} \left( \varepsilon_{a,y}, \varepsilon_{\tilde{a},\tilde{y}} \right) = \frac{\sigma_a \sigma_{\tilde{a}} \rho^{|a-\tilde{a}|}_{a} \rho^{|y-\tilde{y}|}_{y}}{\left(1-\rho^2_{a}\right) \left(1-\rho^2_{y}\right)}\]
and \(\rho_a\) and \(\rho_y\) are the AR1 coefficients in age and year,
respectively. As in m3, \(\sigma^2_a\) for all ages \(a > 1\) are
assumed to be the same but different from age \(a = 1\), \(\sigma^2_R\).

\hypertarget{natural-mortality-m}{%
\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Natural mortality
(\emph{M})}{Natural mortality (M)}}\label{natural-mortality-m}}

WHAM can estimate or fix \(\mu_{M_a}\), the mean natural mortality at
age \emph{a}, or estimate one \emph{M} for all ages, \(\mu_M\), as fixed
effect parameters. In addition, \emph{M} can be specified as a function
of weight-at-age, \(M_{a,y} = \mu_M \text{W}^b_{a,y}\), as in Lorenzen
(1996) and Miller and Hyun (2018). Regardless of whether \(\mu_{M_a}\)
are fixed or estimated, WHAM can estimate random effect deviations in
\emph{M}, \(\delta_{a,y}\), similar to the \emph{NAA} deviations
(Cadigan, 2016; Stock et al., n.d.):

\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{cc}
    \text{log}\left( M_{a,y} \right) = \mu_{M_a} + \delta_{a,y} \\
    \text{Cov} \left( \delta_{a,y}, \delta_{\tilde{a},\tilde{y}} \right) = \frac{\sigma^2_M \varphi^{|a-\tilde{a}|}_{a} \varphi^{|y-\tilde{y}|}_{y}}{\left(1-\varphi^2_{a}\right) \left(1-\varphi^2_{y}\right)}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

where \(\sigma^2_M\), \(\varphi_a\), and \(\varphi_y\) are the AR1
variance and correlation coefficients in age and year, respectively.

In this analysis, we demonstrate three alternative \emph{M} random
effects models. For simplicity, all models treat \(\mu_{M_a}\) as known,
as in the assessments. m1 is identical to the base \emph{NAA} model,
with no random effects on \emph{M}
(\(\sigma^2_M = \varphi_a = \varphi_y = 0\) and not estimated). m2
allows IID \emph{M} deviations, estimating \(\sigma^2_M\) but fixing
\(\varphi_a = \varphi_y = 0\). m3 estimates the full 2D AR1 structure
for \emph{M} deviations.

SAM?}\label{how-is-wham-different-from-sam}}

\emph{Not sure where to put this\ldots{} some could be in Intro or
Discussion. Definitely will be a question in readers' minds so may be
good to introduce early?}

Most assessments in the U.S. assume separability in \(F_{a,t}\),
estimate \(F_t\) and \(Sel_a\). WHAM does this. SAM estimates
\(F_{a,t}\) directly. WHAM and SAM also make different separability
assumptions for the catch/index data (aggregate total + age comps vs.
\(C_{a,t}\) directly). Should be similar (?) but could test.

Goal is to replicate ASAP assessments in the U.S. Northeast. Can easily
turn on/off random effects.

Observation model is natural for landings data that are measured as
total weight plus age composition sampling. Age composition sampling
often done separately with survey data.

Treating \(F\) and \(Sel\) separately can be useful for projections.
Oftentimes we want to specify \(F\) in projections to calculate a
reference point, as opposed to continuing a \(F\) time-series process.

We used R (R Core Team, 2020). WHAM is available as an R package (Miller
and Stock, 2020). Table \ref{tab:model-descriptions} summarizes the

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

We described WHAM. Sim tests showed no bias in self-tests (when
estimation model matched operating model). Some bias in cross-tests.

Contrast mechanistic vs.~empirical approaches. Empirical approaches
allows time-varying productivity and with AR1 can propagate effect of
changing productivity in short-term projections (Stock et al., n.d.).
However, the empirical approach cannot predict values beyond extremes in
observed time-series. This is an issue because many ecosystems are
changing to such extent that conditions in the near future have never
been observed. E.g. last time it was close to this warm on the U.S.
Northeast Shelf was the 1940s, and few fisheries or oceanographic
time-series stretch back that far. Thus, longer term projections likely
require mechanistic approach. Think about other sources of data? Fish
catch, not just surveys + age data? Continuous Plankton Recorder (other
side of Atlantic, but correlated?). 1951 was almost as warm (annual
mean), but warm in winter instead of summer (diff seasonal change).

Mechanistic approach: more likely to find environmental effects in cases
with:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  history of overfishing (Free et al., 2019)
\item
  more rapid environmental change (Free et al., 2019)
\item
  stocks at edge of species' range (Free et al., 2019)
\item
  opportunistic species (short-lived) vs.~longer-lived (Free et al.,
  2019)
\item
  longer time series
\item
  stronger signals (wider ranges of observed stock status and
  environmental conditions)
\item
  periodic signal where we've recorded more than one cycle (e.g.~PDO/sst
  sardine)
\item
  lower trophic level (e.g.~generally tighter relationship between PO
  and zooplankton, then small pelagics TL2, then TL3+). PO forecasting
  group look at zooplankton indices? See Perretti 2017 (recruitment
  regime shifts)
\end{itemize}

Reducing uncertainty may be just as valuable as improving accuracy /
reducing bias.

\hypertarget{future-work}{%
\subsection{Future work}\label{future-work}}

WHAM will be used in upcoming research track assessments. Could
transition to operational. Potential to improve several NEFSC
assessments.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  2D AR(1) selectivity. Most assessments in the U.S. assume separability
  in \(F_{a,t}\), i.e.~estimate \(F_t\) and \(Sel_a\). WHAM does this.
  SAM estimates \(F_{a,t}\) directly. WHAM and SAM make different
  separability assumptions for the catch/index data as well (aggregate
  total + age comps vs. \(C_{a,t}\) directly). Should be similar (?) but
  could test.
\item
  How many time/age-varying random effects can be estimated
  simultaneously? Stock et al. (n.d.) estimated random effect deviations
  in survival and \(M\), as well as an environmental covariate effect on
  recruitment.
\item
  Ecov-Recruitment simulation study. How much information does Ecov need
  to have to be useful?

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

Development of TMB has facilitated significant advancement in fisheries
assessment, allowing us to treat population processes as random effects.
A grand challenge in fisheries is to assess and manage stocks in a
changing environment. Increasingly have the environmental data.
Population time-series are lengthening. WHAM is a step in this
direction.

\caption{Relative error of parameters constraining numbers-at-age (NAA) random effects. Four models were used to simulate 100 datasets keeping fixed effect parameters constant, and then re-fit to each simulated dataset. m1 = only recruitment deviations are random effects (most similar to traditional statistical catch-at-age, SCAA), and deviations are independent and identically distributed (IID). m2 = as m1, but with autocorrelated recruitment deviations ($\text{AR1}_y$). m3 = all NAA deviations are IID random effects. m4 = as m3, but deviations are correlated by age and year (2D AR1). Relative error was calculated as $\frac{\hat{\theta_i}}{\theta} - 1$, where $\hat{\theta_i}$ was the estimate in simulation $i$ for parameter $\theta$, and $\theta$ was the true value (estimate from original dataset).

Five models were used to simulate 100 datasets keeping fixed effect parameters constant, and then re-fit to each simulated dataset. All models estimated recruitment using the Beverton-Holt function and included CPI effects on $\beta$: $\hat{R}_{t+1} = \frac{\alpha S_{t}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{t} + \beta_2 x^2_{t}} S_t}$. m1 = Cold Pool Index (CPI) modeled as a random walk (RW) with no effect on recruitment ($\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$). m2 = CPI as RW, linear effect on $\beta$. m3 = CPI as RW, 2nd order polynomial effect on $\beta$. m4 = CPI as AR1, linear effect. m5 = CPI as AR1, polynomial effect. Relative error was calculated as $\frac{\hat{\theta_i}}{\theta} - 1$, where $\hat{\theta_i}$ was the estimate in simulation $i$ for parameter $\theta$, and $\theta$ was the true value (estimate from original dataset).
