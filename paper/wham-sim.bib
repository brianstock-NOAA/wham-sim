  abstract = {Fisheries science is concerned with the management and understanding of the raising and harvesting of fish. Fish stocks are assessed using biological and fisheries data with the goal of estimating either their total population or biomass. Stock assessment models also make it possible to predict how stocks will respond to varying levels of fishing pressure in the future. Such tools are essential with overfishing now reducing stocks and employment worldwide, with in turn many serious social, economic, and environmental implications. Increasingly, a state-space framework is being used in place of deterministic and standard parametric stock assessment models. These efforts have not only had considerable impact on fisheries management but have also advanced the supporting statistical theory and inference tools as well as the required software. An application of such techniques to the North Sea cod stock highlights what should be considered best practices for sciencebased fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Data used in stock assessment models result from combinations of biological, ecological, fishery, and sampling processes. Since different types of errors propagate through these processes, it can be difficult to identify a particular family of distributions for modelling errors on observations a priori. By implementing several observational likelihoods, modelling both numbers- and proportions-at-age, in an age-based state-space stock assessment model, we compare the model fit for each choice of likelihood along with the implications for spawning stock biomass and mean fishing mortality. We propose using AIC intervals based on fitting the full observational model for comparing different observational likelihoods. Using data from four stocks, we show that the model fit is improved by modelling the correlation of observations within years. However, the best choice of observational likelihood differs for different stocks, and the choice is important for the short-term conclusions drawn from the assessment model; in particular, the choice can influence total allowable catch advise based on reference points.},

This way observed data are linked to unobserved quantities in the population model. Using this framework, we suggest two modifications to improve accuracy in results obtained from the stock assessment model SAM and similar models. The first suggestion is to interpret the ``process error'' in these models as stochastic variation in natural mortality, and therefore include it in the data model. The second suggestion is to consider the observed catch as unbiased estimates of the true catch and modify the observation error accordingly. We demonstrate the efficacy of these modifications using empirical data from 14 fish stocks. Our results indicate that the modifications lead to improved fits to data and prediction performance, as well as reduced prediction bias.},

We tested each projection specification for 12 groundfish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic to identify sources of bias and evaluate techniques for reducing bias. Projections were made from assessments using virtual population analysis (VPA) with 1\textendash 7 years of recent data removed from the full time series and were then compared with results from a VPA assessment on the full time series of data. The main source of bias in projections was the assessment model estimates of the numbers at age in the terminal model year + 1 (Na,T+1). Recruitment was responsible for more bias in projections beyond 3 years, when population numbers begin to be dominated by cohorts that were statistically generated. Retrospective analysis was performed and several adjustment factors to reduce bias were tested. Even after adjusting for bias, the remaining bias in projections was non-negligible. The direction of bias generally resulted in projected spawning stock biomass (SSB) and catch being overestimated, and the bias in catch was nearly always larger than in SSB. Scientists need to clearly communicate the direction and magnitude of this bias, managers need to consider this additional uncertainty when specifying future catch limits, and both scientists and managers need to develop more robust control rules so that objectives are achieved.},

The model utilizes information from offshore trawl surveys, inshore acoustic surveys, fishery catch age compositions, partial fishery landings, and tagging. This is done using an approach that avoids the use of subjective data-weighting. Estimates of fishing mortality rates (F) are usually conditional on assumptions about natural mortality rates (M) in stock assessment models. However, by integrating much of the information on northern cod, it is possible to estimate F and M separately. It is also possible to estimate a change in the offshore survey catchability by including inshore acoustic biomass estimates. The proposed model also accounts for biased total catch statistics, which is a common problem in stock assessments. The main goal of the model is to provide realistic projections of the impacts of various levels of future fishery catches on the recovery of this stock. The projections incorporate uncertainty about M and catch. This is vital information for successful future fisheries. The model has been developed for the specific data sources available for northern cod, but it could be adapted to other stocks with similar data sources.},

We present simulation results which demonstrate that in small-sample settings, our criterion estimates the expected discrepancy with less bias than traditional AIC and certain other competitors.

  abstract = {Penalties are widely used for a range of parameters while fitting fish stock assessment models. Penalizing annual recruitments for deviating from an underlying mean recruitment is probably the most common. Assuming that recruits are log-normally distributed for the purposes of this penalty is theoretically justifiable. In practice, however, bias may be induced because this distributional assumption includes a term equal to the summation of the log observed data, which in the case of recruitment equals the summation of the log recruitment parameters that are not data. Using simulation, the potential for bias caused by assuming that recruits were log-normally distributed was explored, and results were contrasted with the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed, an alternative that avoids the potentially troublesome summation term. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment were negatively biased, while fishing mortality (F) was positively biased under the assumption of log-normally distributed recruitments, and the bias worsened closer to the terminal year. The bias also worsened when the true underlying F was low relative to natural mortality, and with domed fishery selectivity. Bias in SSB, recruitment, and F was nonexistent or relatively small under the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed. Distributional assumptions for penalties used in assessment models should be reviewed to reduce the potential for biased estimation. These results also provide further support for simulation testing to evaluate statistical behavior of assessment models.},

The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method as the "numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method" and compare it to two common methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model, the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods.},

Based on Akaike's information criterion, both the cold pool and spawning stock biomass were important predictors of recruitment and led to annual variation in estimated biomass reference points and associated yield.

We developed a state-space, age-structured assessment model that allowed different assumptions for natural mortality and the degree of temporal stochasticity in abundance. We fit a suite of models where natural mortality was either age-invariant or an allometric function of mass and interannual transitions of abundance were deterministic or stochastic to observations on Gulf of Maine \textendash{} Georges Bank Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus). We found that allowing stochasticity in the interannual transition in abundance was important and estimating age-invariant natural mortality was sufficient. A simulation study showed low bias in annual biomass estimation when the estimation and simulation model matched and the Akaike imformation criterion accurately measured relative model performance, but it was important to allow simulated data sets to include the stochasticity in interannual transitions of abundance-at-age.},

Process variation, which can be both demographic and environmental, is modeled by linking a series of stochastic and deterministic subprocesses that characterize processes such as birth, survival, maturation, and movement. Observations of the population can be modeled as functions of true abundance with realistic probability distributions to describe observation or estimation error. Computer-intensive procedures, such as sequential Monte Carlo methods or Markov chain Monte Carlo, condition on the observed data to yield estimates of both the underlying true population abundances and the unknown population dynamics parameters.

  abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

  abstract = {Climate can impact fish population dynamics through changes in productivity and shifts in distribution, and both responses have been observed for many fish species. However, few studies have incorporated climate into population dynamics or stock assessment models. This study aimed to uncover how past variations in population vital rates and fishing pressure account for observed abundance variation in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus). The influences of the Gulf Stream Index, an index of climate variability in the Northwest Atlantic, on abundance were explored through natural mortality and stock\textendash recruitment relationships in age-structured hierarchical Bayesian models. Posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion indicated that out of tested models, the best estimates of summer flounder abundances resulted from the climatedependent natural mortality model that included log-quadratic responses to the Gulf Stream Index. This climate-linked population model demonstrates the role of climate responses in observed abundance patterns and emphasizes the complexities of environmental effects on populations beyond simple correlations. This approach highlights the importance of modeling the combined effect of fishing and climate simultaneously to understand population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the `well-mixed single-stock' paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (agesize/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the `Robin Hood' paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is welldocumented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

  abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (``derived quantities'') are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional ``plug-in'' estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new ``epsilon'' estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixedeffects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Age-structured production models (ASPMs) are often preferred over biomass aggregated surplus production models (SPMs) as the former can track the propagation of cohorts and explicitly account for the effects of selective fishing, even in the absence of reliable size- or age data. Here, we introduce `JABBA-Select', an extension of the JABBA software (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment; Winker et al., 2018), that is able to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SPMs and allows a direct comparison to ASPMs. JABBASelect incorporates life history parameters and fishing selectivity and distinguishes between exploitable biomass (used to fit indices given fishery selectivity) and spawning biomass (used to predict surplus production). Applying JABBA-Select involves using an age-structured equilibrium model to convert the input parameters into multivariate normal priors for surplus-production productivity parameters. We illustrate the main elements of JABBA-Select using the stock parameters of South African silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus, Scienidae) as a case study. This species is exploited by multiple fisheries and was selected as an example of a data moderate fishery that features strong contrast in selectivity over time and across fleets. For proof-of-concept, we use an agestructured simulation framework to compare the performance of JABBA-Select to: 1) a conventional Bayesian state-space model using a Pella-Tomlinson (PT) production function, 2) an ASPM with deterministic recruitment; and 3) an ASPM with stochastic recruitment. The PT model produced biased estimates of relative and absolute spawning biomass trajectories and associated reference points, which by contrast could be fairly accurately estimated by JABBA-Select. JABBA-Select performed at least as well as the ASPMs in accuracy for most of the performance metrics and best characterized the stock status uncertainty. The results indicate that JABBA-Select is able to accurately account for moderate changes in selectivity and fleet dynamics over time and to provide a robust tool for data-moderate stock assessments.},

  abstract = {The justification for incorporating environmental effects into fisheries stock assessment models has been investigated and debated for a long time. Recently, a state-space age-structured assessment model which includes the stochastic change in the environmental covariate over time and its effect on recruitment was developed for Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea). In this paper, we first investigated the correlations of environmental covariates with Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder recruitment deviations. The covariate that was most strongly correlated with the recruitment deviations was then incorporated into the state-space model and alternative effects on the stock-recruit relationship were estimated and compared. For the model that performed best as measured by Akaike information criterion, we also compared the estimates and predictions of various population attributes and biological reference points with those from an otherwise identical model without the environmental covariate in the stock-recruit function. We found that the estimates of population parameters are similar for the two models but the predictions differed substantially. To evaluate which model provided more reliable predictions, we quantitatively compared the prediction skill of the two models by generating two series of retrospective predictions. Comparison of the retrospective prediction pattern suggested that from an average point of view, the environmentally explicit model can provide more accurate near-term recruitment predictions especially the one year ahead recruitment prediction. However, the accuracy of the near-term recruitment prediction from the environmentally explicit model was largely determined by the accuracy of the corresponding environment prediction the model provides.},
